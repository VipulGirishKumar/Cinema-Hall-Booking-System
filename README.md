# Cinema Hall Booking System

The main objective of the python project is to create a Movie ticket booking system that manages customer booking, seats and details. It manages all the information about booking, payment and choice of seats. The project is built at an administrative end and can thus be accessed only by the administrator. The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the booking, seats and customer details. The application uses files to store the seat booking and save the customer details.
The project includes the following functions:
1.	displayMenu- This function displays the Menu
2.	displayBookings- This function displays the seats that are booked and not booked.
3.	loadBookings- This function loads the previously saved booking from the file ‘seats’.
4.	checkSeat- This function checks whether a seat is available or not.
5.	bookSeat- This function books a seat which is chosen by the user and writes it in the file.
6.	bookSeatAtFront- This function books a seat that is available closest to the screen and writes in the file.
7.	bookSeatAtBack- This function books a seat that is available furthest from the screen and writes in the file.
8.	CancelBooking- This function cancels the user’s booking.
9.	CancelAllBooing- This function cancels all the bookings.
10.	saveBookings- This function writes the seat bookings in a file.
